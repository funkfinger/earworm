# Prompt for v0.dev

Please create a mobile app wireframe that steps the user through the process of getting rid of an earworm. The process is as follows:

1. Greet you and sympathize with your earworm problem
2. Ask you to log into Spotify
3. Help you find the song that's stuck in your head
4. Play a replacement song from your streaming service
5. Follow up to see if the solution worked

The process is hosted by the attached worm SVG file.

Here are the suggested fonts and colors:

- font: Playpen Sans
- background color: #4e342e
- text color: #ddd2a7
- highlight color: #ef798a
- accent color a: #727d71
- accent color b: #586f7c

The technology stack is as follows:

- Next.js v15.2
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn UI v2.3.0
- Radix UI v3.1.3
- Spotify Web Playback SDK: https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-playback-sdk
