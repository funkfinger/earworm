Develop a mobile application with a hand-drawn aesthetic, incorporating PNG images for all UI elements such as buttons, borders, and other visual components. The application's design should embody a quirky and cute style, featuring playful elements and animations to enhance user engagement. The application's mascot is a worm named "QT", and the design should reflect this character's personality. QT will walk the user through the steps to get rid of their earworm with each step being a page in the app. The application should be designed for mobile devices, ensuring optimal usability and responsiveness across various screen sizes. The application should be built with the information in the attached README file and utilize images of "QT" our mascot.svg
